## Gameplay

The gameplay loop for our title is mechanically focused and simple by nature. However, as the player progresses they will find it has a surprising degree of difficulty. 

Essentially, a player has to combine potions in their hardy cauldron while referencing a formula sheet next to them. However, the only light source is one rogue wave away from going out!

In the dark, our player can still interact with their surroundings, but can no longer see the recipe. This singular mechanic brings the game from a simple beat-the-clock loop, to a progressing hybrid between timed solution and memory puzzle. Darkness isn't their only enemy though...

It looks like their recipe copier was on the frits, now the more complex formulas have been switched around the place! Oh well, the final potion is still outlined. We trust an experienced alchemist to figure out the rest :)  

### Controls

Left click - Select potion, select cauldron, pick up paper.

### Instructions
- To reference the recipe, click the recipe paper on the left-side of the table. It will move closer to view, where formulas can be better seen.  
- To select a potion to mix, hover the cursor over an outlined potion and click. From there click the cauldron to mix it into the brewing concoction.
- Once a potion is ready to submit, click the cauldron. Wow a new potion has appeared! 
- If a potion has been incorrectly mixed into the cauldron, click the cauldron to reset the table's ingredients. 

## Summary

In Turbulent Tinctures, you take on the role of an overworked alchemist traveling on a ship. Storms are on the horizon but that doesn't mean you aren't on the clock! You need to make a potion, and quick! 

Using your strained alchemist eyes and overworked pattern recognition, combine the color coded potions according to your formula sheet. In the end, your goal is to make your final concoction and beat the level!

Be wary though, there be rough seas out there, enough to make your trusty reading lantern go out... If only you had night vision goggles... Fantasy budget cuts be damned! 

### Theme Relevance

In our attempt to follow the theme, we took things pretty literally.

The shadowy aspect of the game is present with the lantern casting shadows and blocking out the player's view of their recipe sheet. An alchemist's worse nightmare! But don't worry, the player always has an emotional support chest close by. Supporting them with its piercing gaze...

The alchemy aspect is also very straight forward,  as the player is always mixing and transmuting potions throughout the gameplay loop. I think there's a title for people who make alchemic mixtures. A title only the philosophers really know, however they also told me they have a really cool stone on sale!

### Tinctures and Tunes

We are proud to proclaim that all 3D assets and sound effects were made by us :)

The music was remixed from the OSRS soundtrack.
